# QM_StealthInspect

### This is a mod for the game Quazimorph.

Allows you to change from sneaking to standing after inspecting a creature or rotating your character without a forced turn.

It's clearly intentional that they want this, so keep in mind it may have balance implications. Maybe your unfair run will be slightly less so.

I like to be able to recon without the tedium of standing up before inspecting every enemy in a room, but of course it's personal preference.

This mod should only change what happens when the player is sneaking and changes direction/inspects a creature.
