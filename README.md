# QM_StealthInspect

### This is a mod for the game Quazimorph.

Allows you to change from sneaking to standing after inspecting a creature or rotating your character without a forced turn.

The behavior which causes the player to have to stand up after inspecting a creature while sneaking is tied to changing view direction.
Inspecting happens with right click, which also turns the player.

The devs use a special flag for cases where they want this behavior. For example:
    1) when a sneaking player changes their facing direction
    2) when a sneaking player changes to another weapon

It's clearly intentional that they want this, so keep in mind it may have balance implications. Maybe your unfair run will be slightly less so.

I like to be able to recon without the tedium of standing up before inspecting every enemy in a room, but of course it's personal preference.

This mod should only change what happens when the player is sneaking and changes direction/inspects a creature.
